						<div class="card-content-inner">We are planning to do some exciting cross country flights during this course. Every day, before we take off we will be looking on the map and set a challenging task that we are keen to fly. In our excitement to learn new skills we very often forget how to fly and how to fly safely. It is common for people to fail launches and landings due to their eagerness. Also seen is; pilots, who are usually on top of everyone, suddenly bomb out for no reason. When you aim to go cross country, you have to realize that you will be tested on your basic flying skills as well. You will not get to great distances if you fail on launching, thermalling or landing. Therefore, I want to start this course with some words on the basics in relation to cross country flying.</div>

						<div class="card-content-inner">For a good cross country flight you need to get high first. Therefore, it is rather frustrating if you go straight down after your take off and you need to scratch half way the hill for an hour. This you can prevent with timing your take off right. You want to launch in a good cycle. If you study the environment for a while you should be able to recognize the thermal activity and determine whether the conditions are good to stay aloft. You can derive the cyclic activity by studying the clouds, the birds, other pilots and the wind direction and strength at launch. It is very worthwhile to just sit on launch and study the situation of the day.</div>

						<div class="card-content-inner"><p>Next you have to thermal up to (cloud) base. You need to select the thermalling technique that works for you with the active thermal type. When you have decided on your thermal approach strategy you can focus on doing it at your best.</p><div><img src="img/theory_thermals.jpg" width="100%"></img><br><i>Textbook thermals</i></div><div><img src="img/theory_lavalamp.jpg" width="100%"></img><br><i>Lava lamp model</i></div><p>You may consider two thermal models. When it is a smooth and big column of rising air, it is a text book thermal. This thermal type you will probably be able to map accurately in your mind, such that you can steer to use the thermal to its optimum capacity. However, most thermals fit the lava lamp model. It is an unpredictable collection of rising blobs of warm air, never predictable and hard to map in your mind.</p><p>There are multiple techniques available, which target different thermal models: <ol><li>Shift in the direction of the quarter that gave least gain</li><li>Increase bank when vertical speed decreases and decrease bank when vertical speed increases</li><li>High siding</li><li>Push out in stronger thermal part</li></ol></p></div>

					<div class="card-content">
						<div class="card-content-inner"><p>Last, to make your day a happy one, you need to perform a feel good landing. As we are going cross country, you most probably will land in a place you have never been before. This is actually quite cool, but it requires from you to make a good landing plan from the air. You need to select a field that is large enough, flat, free from turbulence and does not contain things or animals to fly into. It is quite an assessment to do. Once you have selected your perfect field, you need to make a plan on how to approach it. All these assessment tasks will consume time. Therefore, it is suggested to start thinking about it when you are still high enough. This will render you time and altitude, to actually perform the landing as you figured out.</p></div>
