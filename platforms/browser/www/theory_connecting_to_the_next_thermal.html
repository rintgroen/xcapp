						<div class="card-content-inner">If you have done it all right, and you are really high above launch, you can finally go cross country. Before the thermal strength drops below zero, you need to have a sense of where to go. From here, you want to fly in a straight line directly into your next thermal that brings you closer to the goal of the day. Generally you will fly in the direction of the task line, but when you notice a strong thermal not far off course line, you might go there instead.</div>

					<div class="card-content">
						<div class="card-content-inner"><p>To determine what your next thermal will be you have to consider and check a couple of things. You want to take into account the thermal cycles. You may have already experienced that you fly to that nice cloud where other pilots where zooming up fast, but just as you arrive there is no lift left for you. The thermal source died and the rising air got to a stop.</p><p>This is all about trying to connect to the furthest strong thermal on your track. If there are two equally strong thermals on your route, you want to take the furthest one, if you are able to make it there. Trying to find the core of a thermal takes time, so if you only have to this once you will save time and proceed faster. You want to be high enough to make it.</p><div><img src="img/theory_glidecomparison.png" width="100%"><img><br><i>Compare different glide strategies</i></div><p>Gliding between thermals. Four gliders leave the thermal on the right at the same time; the trajectories shown cover the same length of elapsed time. Glider A stops in every weak thermal; he has low probability of landout but achieves a low total speed. Glider B heads toward the strong thermal at the speed of best glide angle, with minimum loss of height. Glider C flies faster: although he loses more height in the glide, the rapid climb more than compensates. Glider D flies even faster; unfortunately he is forced to land before he reaches the thermal.</p></div>

						<div class="card-content-inner"><p>About speed to fly, when a thermal is nearby and pilots are cranking up, you generally want to get there as fast as possible. However, if the thermal requires some glide to get there, you would better make sure you make the connection and you have to assess whether this thermal where everybody is in, is indeed your best option. If you are on a glide to the next thermal you want to fly at a speed that you do not lose too much altitude, but also you do not want to lose too much time.<br>[Add image with shifted polar]<br>[Add McCready explanation]<br>[Add Dolphin technique: speed up in sinking air, slow down in rising air.]</p></div>

						<div class="card-content-inner"><p>Change your direction if you are continuously in sinking air. 60 degrees is sometimes suggested, but you would rather look at the clouds or thermal sources. If there is (almost) no wind, convection in the air is by nature organized in the so called Rayleigh-Benard cells. This creates a hexagonal pattern of clouds.</p><div><img src="img/theory_rayleighbernard.png" width="100%"></img><br><i>Expect hexagonal pattern of clouds in still air</i></div><p>Due to wind the hexagonal pattern is disrupted and the thermal cells will line up in streets. On a cloudy day with strong enough winds you may find the so called cloud streets, which will give you a good line of lift, if you align your flight path along those streets.</p><div><img src="img/theory_cloudstreets.jpg" width="100%"></img><br><i>Clouds lined up in streets of lift</i></div></div>
